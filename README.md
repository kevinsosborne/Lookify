# Lookify
Lookify (JAVA) - I created a crud-based playlist web app. The user can add new song titles, artists, and songâ€™s rating as well as delete them. The user can also search for a specific artist and view all their related songs.  Finally, the user can view all the top ranked songs and click on each song for more detailed info. 
Technologies user include JAVA, Spring Boot.
